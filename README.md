## About
A fast TCP/UDP tunnel, transported over HTTP WebSocket.
You are right. This project is inspired by `jpillora/chisel` (and subsequently
my fork `myzhang1029/penguin`), but completely rewritten in Rust without any
linkage to `chisel`. The logo is generated by [DALL-E](https://labs.openai.com)
with the prompt ["a penguin standing behind a gear wheel, digital art, logo."](
  https://labs.openai.com/s/Et1VIeCBREIRHhF7MU9NoZL6
)

## Basic Usage
### Server
```bash
$ penguin server --host ::1 --port 443 --tls-cert cert.pem --tls-key key.pem --ws-psk some-secret
```
See `penguin server --help` for more options.

### Client
```bash
$ penguin client --ws-psk some-secret wss://server 1080:socks 80:example.com:80
```
See `penguin client --help` for more options.

## Comparison
Compared to the original `penguin` or `chisel`, this project stripped away
some functionalities:

- There is no internal SSH tunnels because it results in double encapsulation
  when used with HTTPS/WSS.

- There is no user/password authentication because we do not have SSH. Instead,
  use PSK authentication.

- There is no server keep-alive because client keep-alive is enough.

- ~~There is no support to acquire an ACME certificate on-the-fly.~~ (Implemented)

- There is no reverse port forwarding because I am too lazy. (TODO!)

Other than that, this project offers these functionalities compared to
`chisel`:

- Plausible deniability with WebSocket PSK and working `backend`.

- TLS certificate hot-reload with `SIGUSR1`.

- Higher performance: my crude testing on my machine reveals that `penguin` is
  approximately 2x faster than `chisel` on my machine.

- All the safety Rust offers.

## Protocol
Servers and clients with the same protocol version are compatible with each other. However, for the best performance, it is recommended to use the same version of `penguin` on both sides.

The current protocol version is `penguin-v6`. See [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) for details.
